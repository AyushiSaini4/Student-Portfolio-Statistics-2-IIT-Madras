# Statistics Portfolio – IIT Madras BS Degree

This repository contains my Statistics Course Extra Activity for the IIT Madras Online Degree program.
The project demonstrates data collection, organization, and analysis using Google Sheets and GitHub Pages.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset features the Top 100 Movies from IMDb, with the following columns:

* Rank – Position of the movie in the top 100 list
* Movie Title – Name of the film
* Release Year – Year of release
* IMDb Rating – Average user rating (out of 10)
* Genre – Primary genre of the film

## 🔍 Key Observations

* Drama and Crime are the most common genres among top-rated films.
* Many of the highest-rated movies were released between 1990 and 2010, a period of modern classics.
* Timeless films like The Godfather (1972) and 12 Angry Men (1957) maintain high ratings even decades later.
